Warframe is a grind, there’s no doubt about that. But, with the Ayatan Celebs now in the game, it can be a lot easier! In this guide, we will teach you how to slot these celebs into your warframe chili and enjoy the benefits!

To start off, you will need an Ayatan Sculpture. The sculptures can be obtained by hunting for treasure across the solar system or alternatively, by trading with other players. If you are having trouble finding one, make sure to check out our wiki page for more information.

With your sculpture in hand, it’s time to get started on your warframe chili. The first step is to install the Ayatan plugin. This can be done by opening your plugin manager and installing the “Ayatana Celebs” mod.

Once the plugin is installed, it’s time to add some celebs to your game! To do this, open up your mission console and type in “/cembedding add [Celeb Name]” followed by enter. For example, if you wanted to add John Cena to your game, you would type in /cembedding add John Cena and hit enter.

If everything went correctly, you should now see John Cena as an available celebrity to embed into your warframe chili! Simply select him (or any other celeb) and hit enter to begin the process.

When adding a celeb to your game, there are a few things you will want to keep in mind:

-The celeb’s stats will affect the stats of your warframe chili. Make sure to pick a celeb that has stats that match what you are looking for!
-The level of the celeb will also affect the level of your warframe chili. Again, make sure to pick a celeb that is close in level to what you are looking for!-The rarity of the sculpture will determine how many mods slots the resulting warframe chili will have.





Now that you know how to add celebs to your game, let's take a look at what they do! When embedded into your warframe chili, celebs will grant it various bonuses such as bonus damage or health regen!

#  The 5 Best Ways to Slot Ayatan Celebrities in Warframe Chile!

Ayatan sculptures have been a big thing since they were first released as part of the Specters of the Rail update back in 2016. The addictive game mechanic that revolves around collecting these rare items and then displaying them in your homes has driven many players to seek out new and better ways to get their hands on these ancient treasures. 

Warframe Chile, being the great game that it is, has not been left out of this craze and offers many different ways for players to hunt down Ayatan sculptures. Here are the 5 best ways to slot Ayatan celebrities in Warframe Chile:

1) Void Relics: Probably the most popular way to get Ayatan sculptures, Void relics offer a random chance at dropping an Ayatan sculpture upon opening. This method can be time-consuming, but also offers the potential for getting multiple sculptures at once.

2) Trading: Another popular way to get your hands on Ayatan sculptures is through trading with other players. This can be done by using the in-game trading system or through various online marketplaces.

3) Orokin Derelict Survival: This game mode tasks players with surviving against waves of enemies in order to extract an Orokin relic. The relics often containAyatan sculptures as rewards.

4) Syndicate Missions: Most syndicate missions offer unique rewards for completing them, including Ayatan sculptures. This can be a great way to get hold of some of the more difficult-to-find sculptures.

5) Solar Rail SYSTEM: The Solar Rail SYSTEM is a new endgame content introduced as part of Update 24 and offers some of the best chances for obtaining Ayatan sculptures. It involves travelling to different planets and capturing relay points in order to activate a beam that transports players to a boss encounter. Killing the boss rewards players with an Ayatan sculpture.

#  How to Maximize Your Ayatan Celebs in Warframe Chile

Ayatan sculptures have become one of the most coveted items in Warframe. Players are always on the lookout for ways to acquire more ayatan celebs, while also trying to find the best way to use them in their builds. In this guide, we'll go over some tips on how to maximize your ayatan celebs in Warframe Chile.

The first thing you need to do is make sure that you're taking advantage of the ayatan stars and planets that are available to you. You can find these by opening your map and looking for the star and planet icons. When you're close enough, you'll see an outline of the ayatan sculpture that's associated with that star or planet.

Once you've acquired an ayatan celeb, you'll want to socket it into a suitable weapon or frame mod. There are a few important things to keep in mind when selecting a mod:

- Ayatan celebs add Vitality and Polarity slots to mods, so be sure to select mods that have those attributes.

- The more vanity slots an ayatan celeb has, the more benefits it provides. For example, celebs with three vanity slots will increase your maximum health, energy and shields by 25%.

- The final attribute that you should consider is weapon type. Some celebs are better suited for specific weapon types. For example, assault rifles benefit from celeb stats like magazine size and critical chance boosts, while sniper rifles benefit from increases in zoom distance and fire rate bonuses.

Once you've selected a mod, it's important to match up the polarity of the ayatan celeb with the polarity of the mod slot. If they don't match up, you can use an Orokin Cell to change the polarity of the slot. Just be aware that this will also change the stats of the ayatan celeb.

If you're looking for ways to improve your build further, here are a few additional tips:

- Use an aura mod like Energy Siphon or Hunter Adrenaline along with an ayatan celeb that has energy siphon bonuses. This will help keep your energy levels high during combat.

- Use an ayatan celeb with bonuses to health or shield regeneration if you're using abilities like Oberon's Renewal or Trinity's Blessing which rely on those stats being maxed out.
