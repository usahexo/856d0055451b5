#  How to Play 21 Blackjack and Win Every Time 

Playing blackjack can be both fun and profitable, but only if you play smart. In this article, we will teach you how to play the game effectively so that you can come out on top every time.

The first step is to learn the rules of the game. Blackjack is a card game in which the goal is to achieve a hand value of 21 or less without going over. The player is dealt two cards and can choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). Aces are worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and other cards are worth their number value. The player's hand is compared against the dealer's hand, and the player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand, loses if their hand is lower, and ties if both hands have the same value.

Once you know the rules, it's important to choose the right strategy for your game. Different strategies work better against different dealers, so it's important to pick one that will give you the best odds of winning. One popular strategy is called basic strategy, which is a mathematically-proven way to reduce the house edge to as close to zero as possible. You can find detailed basic strategy charts online that show you exactly what moves to make in any given situation.

Another important thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is bankroll management. Your bankroll is the amount of money you are willing to risk while playing blackjack. It's important to never bet more than you can afford to lose, so always be mindful of your bankroll when making wagers.

If you follow these tips, you'll be on your way to winning at blackjack every time!

#  What are the Odds in Poker? 

In poker, the odds are the probabilities of particular hands being made. Understanding the odds is essential to becoming a winning player.

There are many types of poker, but in general, the goal is to make the best five-card hand from the seven cards you are dealt. The most common type of poker is Texas Hold'em, which is played with two cards in your hand and five community cards.

To calculate the odds of making a particular hand, you need to know which cards are available in the community deck. For example, if you are dealt two queens and there are three queens on the board, then your odds of making a royal flush are 6 out of 44, or 1 in 7.5.

Here's a list of some of the more common hands and their odds: 

One pair - 2.3 to 1 
Two pairs - 5.1 to 1 
Three of a kind - 8 to 1 
Straight - 4.6 to 1 
Flush - 5 to 1 
Full house - 11.8 to 1 
Four of a kind - 50 to 1 
Straight flush - 362 to 1 
Royal flush - 64960 to 1
