# How do I use the casino wildz poker set?

To play Poker using the Casino Wildz Poker Set:


1) Shuffle the cards and deal five to each player - face down. The rest of the cards are placed face down in the middle of the players as the 'pot'. 
2) Each player picks up their cards and looks at them. The player with the highest ranking card (Aces are high) starts the betting round by either betting, checking or folding. 
3) Play then proceeds clockwise around the table with players either betting, checking or folding as the action moves to them. 
4) When all but one player has folded, that player takes all of the cards in the pot (face down), turns them over and arranges them into one neat stack. 
5) The final player left in turn over his/her two cards - these are now used to determine the winning hand. The best five-card hand takes first place (using traditional Poker rankings). If both players have identical hands, then it is a draw and no money changes hands.
