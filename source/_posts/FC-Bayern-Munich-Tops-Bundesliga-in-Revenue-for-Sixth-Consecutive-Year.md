#  FC Bayern Munich Tops Bundesliga in Revenue for Sixth Consecutive Year

FC Bayern Munich announced record revenue of €640 million for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. This marks the sixth consecutive year that FC Bayern has topped the Bundesliga in revenue. The club attributes its financial success to continued on-field success and strong commercial partnerships.

Commercial partnerships accounted for €333 million of FC Bayern’s total revenue, a 2% increase from the previous fiscal year. This growth was primarily due to increased sponsorship income and the commencement of a new naming rights agreement with Deutsche Telekom in July 2018. FC Bayern also generated significant broadcast income, totaling €194 million during the 2017-2018 season.

FC Bayern’s on-field performance played a significant role in its overall financial success. The club reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and finished second in the Bundesliga, which resulted in increased matchday and broadcasting income. In addition, FC Bayern recorded an operating profit of €120 million, up from €103 million in the previous fiscal year.

The club expects its revenue to top €700 million in the current fiscal year, driven by another successful Champions League campaign and strong commercial partnerships. This would make FC Bayern the first German club to break the €700 million barrier in revenue.

FC Bayern Munich’s continued dominance of Bundesliga revenues underscores the strength of Germany’s top football league. With average attendances above 43,000 and lucrative broadcast deals, Bundesliga clubs are well positioned to compete with Europe’s elite clubs on both financial and sporting terms.

#  FC Bayern Munich Wins 7th Straight Bundesliga Title

FC Bayern Munich has lifted the Bundesliga trophy for the seventh consecutive season, and this year, it was a close call. The Bavarian giants only secured the title on the final day of the season, edging Borussia Dortmund by two points.

The drama kicked off in December when Bayern lost 2-1 away to RB Leipzig. This loss allowed Dortmund to open up a seven-point lead at the top of the table. Dortmund looked destined to win their first Bundesliga title since 2012 until they suffered a number of defeats in April, allowing Bayern to make a late surge.

Bayern’s biggest test came in their penultimate game of the season when they faced Dortmund at home. The match ended in a 0-0 draw, meaning that Bayern had to win their last game of the season against Eintracht Frankfurt if they wanted to retain their title.

Frankfurt took an early lead in that game, but Bayern hit back with three goals in quick succession to secure all three points and the Bundesliga trophy. This was manager Niko Kovac’s first league title as manager of Bayern Munich.

Now that they have won their seventh straight Bundesliga title, Bayern Munich are just one short of equalling the record set by Hamburg SV between 1982 and 1987.
