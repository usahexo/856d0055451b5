Pokemon Yellow is a classic game that was first released in 1998 for the Nintendo Game Boy. In the game, players can try their luck at the slot machine in the Celadon City Game Corner to win coins and prizes. But how exactly does the Pokemon Yellow slot machine work? Let's find out.

## The Basics

The slot machine in Pokemon Yellow has three reels with various symbols on them. Players can bet one, two, or three coins and then spin the reels. If the symbols on the reels match up in a winning combination, the player will receive a payout of coins or a prize.

- Clefairy
- Jigglypuff
- Charmander
- Squirtle
- Bulbasaur
- BAR
- 7

Each symbol has a different value and some are more rare than others. For example, Pikachu is the most valuable symbol and three Pikachus in a row will give the player the jackpot.

## Betting

Players can bet one, two, or three coins on each spin. The more coins that are bet, the higher the potential payout. Betting three coins is the only way to be eligible for the jackpot.

## Jackpot

The jackpot in the Pokemon Yellow slot machine is 300 coins. To win the jackpot, players must bet three coins and land three Pikachus in a row on the reels.
