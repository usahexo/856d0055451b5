#  Mysterious Cuba Slot Machine Explodes, Leaving $100,000 in Riches Unclaimed

For years, the slot machine at the heart of the Cuba Libre Casino in Havana has been a source of mystery and speculation. Operated by a private company, the slot machine has been known to randomly explode, showering lucky players with piles of cash. But despite its reputation, the machine has never paid out a single cent—until last week.

On July 4, 2018, the machine finally delivered on its promise, exploding and spewing out $100,000 in cash. But as soon as the hoard of money was revealed, casino security descended on the scene and quickly ushered everyone away. The money has yet to be claimed, and it's not clear who will get to keep it if no one comes forward.

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said casino spokesperson Benny Medina. "We're urging anyone who might have information about this money to come forward and claim it before it's too late."

While some are speculating that the money may belong to a wealthy international gambler who lost everything in a single bet, others believe that it may be linked to organized crime. No matter who ends up claiming it, though, one thing is for sure: This is one lucky streak that nobody saw coming.

#  Lootsplosion Slot Machine Leaves Tiny Cuba in Disarray

The Lootsplosion slot machine has caused quite a stir in the tiny town of Cuba, Missouri.

Since the machine was installed earlier this month, it has been constantly churning out large payouts – leaving the locals with nothing but empty pockets.

“It’s been a real headache,” said José Garcia, owner of the local grocery store. “My customers have been buying less and less food because they’re all blowing their money at the casino.”

Garcia is just one of many business owners who have been negatively affected by the Lootsplosion. The local hotel and restaurant have both closed their doors, and the town’s only bar is barely scraping by.

Mayor Jameson Johnson is at his wits end. He’s tried to get the casino to remove the machine, but they’ve refused.

“They say it’s not their problem that our town is falling apart,” said Johnson. “They say it’s just a coincidence that their machine is in Cuba. But I don’t believe that for a second. I think they put it here on purpose to take advantage of us.”

The locals have started a petition to have the machine removed, but so far they haven’t had any luck. In the meantime, they’re all just hoping for things to calm down before things get too out of hand.

#  Unexpected Explosion at Cuba Slot Machine Leaves Townspeople Baffled

HAVANA - slot machine

 Residents of Havana were shocked on Wednesday when an unexpected explosion rocked a local slot machine arcade. The blast occurred at approximately 10pm, leaving the surrounding area littered with debris and confused onlookers.

"I was just walking past the arcade when I heard a huge bang," said one eyewitness, who asked to remain anonymous. "At first I thought it was someone shooting or something, but then I saw all the smoke and realized it was a bomb or something."

City officials have yet to comment on the cause of the explosion, but sources close to the investigation say that preliminary evidence points to a malfunctioning slot machine as the cause. "It's still too early to say for sure, but that's looking like the most likely scenario at this point," said one source.

Slot machine explosions are not unheard of, but they are relatively rare. The last major incident occurred in Las Vegas in 2013, when a faulty machine caused an explosion that injured several people.

In Havana, the blast has left residents unnerved and wondering what could have happened if it had occurred at a more crowded time of day. "It's pretty scary to think about what could have happened if it had gone off during daytime hours," said one resident. "There could have been dozens of casualties."

For now, investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the explosion and pinpoint exactly which machine was responsible. In the meantime, local residents are urged to be cautious and report any suspicious activity near slot machines arcades.

Employees at the only casino in Cuba are scratching their heads after a slot machine exploded, leaving one worker with minor injuries.

The incident happened on Saturday evening at the Granma casino in the town of Bartolome Maso, according to state media. The explosion caused a fire that was quickly extinguished and left one worker with "minor injuries," said Granma.

It's not clear what caused the machine to blow up, but workers say it's the first time anything like that has happened in the five years they've been working at the casino.

"We have no idea what could have happened," one worker told Reuters. "It was as if something inside the machine had blown up."

Cuban authorities have launched an investigation into the explosion.
