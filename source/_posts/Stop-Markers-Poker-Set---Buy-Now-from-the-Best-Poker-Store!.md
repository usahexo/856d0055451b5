What is Stop Markers Poker?

Stop Markers Poker is a variation of the popular card game poker. The main difference is that players use stop markers instead of cards to determine the winning hand.

How do you play?

The basic rules of Stop Markers Poker are as follows:

1. Shuffle the stop markers and place them face down in the middle of the playing area.
2. Each player draws five stop markers and places them in front of them, also face down. 
3. The player with the highest card in their hand begins the game and play progresses clockwise from there. 
4. On a player's turn they must draw one stop marker from the playing area, if they can't then they must forfeit their turn. 
5. Once a player has four stop markers in front of them, they must place one back into the playing area.   6. The aim of the game is to remove all of your opponent's stop markers by either capturing them with your own stop marker or through converting them to cards (explained below). 
7. The game ends when one player no longer has any stop markers left in front of them and that player is declared the winner. 
8. In case of a tie, both players lose the game.





To win a hand in Stop Markers Poker, you need to capture as many opponent's stop markers as possible using your own stop marker or by converting them to cards ( explained below ). You can also win a hand if you manage to remove all of your opponents' stop markers, regardless of how many you yourself have captured .





Stop markers can be converted to cards if they are adjacent to each other . When this happens, the two stop markers are placed together so that only one card remains ( see image below ). If at any point all five of a player's stop markers are converted to cards, then that player automatically loses the hand .

When it comes to choosing a poker set, there are a few things you need to consider. The first is the type of poker set you want. There are three main types:
