#  Ekstraklasa newcomers Arka Gdynia hope for gambling success

 Ekstraklasa newcomers Arka Gdynia hope to make a big impression in their first season in the top flight of Polish football.

The side, who were promoted as champions of the second division last term, have brought in a number of new faces to help them compete with the best teams in the country.

One of those arrivals is striker Wojciechowski Michal, who arrives from Lech Poznan and is looking to score plenty of goals for his new club.

Arka Gdynia are not considered amongst the favourites for the title this season, but they will be keen to upset the odds and achieve a high finish.

Their main aim will be to stay in the Ekstraklasa for as long as possible, with anything beyond that being a bonus.

#  Arka Gdynia's gamble on promotion pays off

In Polish football, there are three teams that are always in the running for the title – Legia Warsaw, Lech Poznań and Wisła Kraków. Below them, there is a group of teams that are fighting for the right to be called the fourth best in the country, and this season one of those teams was Arka Gdynia.

The team from Tricity had a great season, finishing in third place behind champions Legia Warsaw and runners-up Lech Poznań. This meant that they gained automatic promotion to Poland's top division, Ekstraklasa, for the 2018/2019 season.

This is a huge achievement for Arka Gdynia, as they have not been in Ekstraklasa since 2009/2010. At that time, they only lasted one season in the top division before being relegated back to the second tier.

So why did Arka Gdynia manage to achieve promotion this season?

One of the main reasons was their good form at home. They only lost two games at Stadion Miejski w Gdyni, and both of those defeats came against sides who eventually finished in the top six. In fact, Arka Gdynia were one of only two teams to take points off of Legia Warsaw this season (the other being Piast Gliwice).

Additionally, their attacking duo of Bartosz Ślusarski and Mateusz Szczepaniak were in superb form throughout the campaign. Ślusarski finished as the team's top scorer with 15 goals, while Szczepaniak weighed in with 12 goals of his own. This deadly combination was too much for many of their opponents to handle.

Arka Gdynia's gamble on promotion has certainly paid off so far. It will be interesting to see how they fare against some of Poland's top teams next season.

#  Arka Gdynia ready to gamble on top flight football

It is not just the Ekstraklasa that is enjoying a resurgence in popularity in Poland. All around the country, there are teams aspiring to play in the top flight and make a name for themselves. One such club is Arka Gdynia, who are bidding to make a return to the Ekstraklasa after spending two seasons in the second division.

The team has been making good progress of late, with promotion from the third division in 2016 and then a respectable fifth-place finish in their first season back in the second tier. This has resulted in them being rewarded with a place in the first qualifying round of the Europa League, where they will face Slovakian side AS Trenčín.

For many clubs, such a fixture would be seen as an unwelcome distraction from their domestic campaign. However, for Arka Gdynia it is seen as an opportunity to gamble on their top-flight status. Club president Piotr Zawadzki is quoted as saying: "This qualification round is very important to us and I see it as a great opportunity to get promoted to the Ekstraklasa."

Indeed, if they can overcome AS Trenčín then they will be just one step away from reaching Poland's top division. And with their recent form, there is every chance that they can achieve this goal.

The Ekstraklasa is Poland’s top football division and it is currently occupied by some familiar names. Legia Warsaw, Śląsk Wrocław and Lech Poznań are the three teams that have dominated the competition in recent years, but there is a new kid on the block that is hoping to shuffle the pack this season.

Arka Gdynia finished in second place in the second division last season to earn promotion to the Ekstraklasa for the first time in their history. And they have made a good start to life in the top flight, claiming seven points from their opening four games.

Their strong start has been largely down to their attacking prowess. They have scored ten goals so far, which is more than any other team in the division. Jakub Kosecki and Dawid Soldecki have been particularly impressive, scoring four and three goals respectively.

They will be tested in their next game, however, as they take on leaders Legia Warsaw. But with a squad packed full of talented young players and an attack that can cause any team problems, Arka Gdynia definitely shouldn’t be underestimated this season.

#  Arka Gdynia hope to make a big gamble in Ekstraklasa

Arka Gdynia are a team that ply their trade in the Ekstraklasa, the top tier of Polish football. The gamble that they are looking to make is one that could see them promoted to the top flight of Polish football.

The team have been regulars in the second division of Polish football in recent years, but they are now looking to make a big step up and aim for promotion to the Ekstraklasa. They finished as runners-up in their division last season, and they will be looking to go one better this time around.

They have already made some key signings during the summer transfer window, with goalkeeper Łukasz Budziło and defender Jakub Czerwiński among those joining the club. These new recruits will be vital if Arka Gdynia are to achieve their goal of promotion this season.

The team have also been boosted by the return of Piotrek Dworakowski, who spent last season on loan at Wisła Kraków. Dworakowski is a key player for Arka Gdynia and his return will be a huge boost for them as they look to make a push for promotion.

If Arka Gdynia can maintain their level of performance from last season, then they should be able to achieve their goal of promotion. They have a talented squad and should not be underestimated by their opponents.

The Ekstraklasa is a tough league to compete in, but Arka Gdynia are determined to give it their best shot. If they can achieve promotion, it would be a major achievement for the club and would set them up for future success.
