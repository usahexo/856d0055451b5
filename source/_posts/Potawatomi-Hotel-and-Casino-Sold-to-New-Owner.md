#  Potawatomi Hotel and Casino Sold to New Owner

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been sold to a new owner for an undisclosed amount. The casino is the fifth-largest in the state and employs over 2,000 people.

The new owner is Chicago-based businessmen Neil Bluhm and Jennifer Jacobs. Bluhm is the chairman of Rush Gaming and has a net worth of $2.6 billion. Jacobs is the president of Rush Gaming and has a net worth of $1.7 billion.

The two released a statement saying that they were excited to own the casino and planned on investing in it to make it even more successful. They also said that they planned on being good neighbors to the community and would be looking for ways to give back to the city.

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino opened in 1991 and has been owned by the Forest County Potawatomi tribe since then. The tribe will continue to own and operate its other businesses, including the Four Winds Casino Resort in New Buffalo, Michigan, and the Thunderbird Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.

#  Potawatomi Hotel and Casino Remains in the Family

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino has been a fixture in the Milwaukee area for over four decades. The casino was first opened in July of 1974 by the Potawatomi Indians of Wisconsin. At the time, it was the only Native American casino in the state.

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino remains under the ownership of the Potawatomi Indian Nation to this day. The casino has undergone several expansions over the years, most notably in 1995, when a new hotel tower was added. In 2001, a convention center was added, and in 2006, a new gaming floor was added.

In recent years, there have been several attempts by other tribes to open casinos in Wisconsin. However, all of these efforts have been unsuccessful due to the strong lobbying efforts of the Potawatomi Indian Nation.

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino continues to be one of the most popular casinos in Wisconsin. It offers a wide variety of games, including slots, table games, and poker. It also has a hotel and convention center, which are both popular with tourists and business travelers.

#  Potawatomi Hotel and Casino Sold to Out-of-State Developer

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been sold to an out-of-state developer for an undisclosed amount.

The hotel and casino, which opened in 1992, is one of the most successful in the state, bringing in over $300 million in revenue last year.

The new owner is reportedly a company from Las Vegas, Nevada, which plans to keep the casino open and operating as usual.

This is the second major casino sale in Wisconsin in as many months. In November, the Menominee Indian Tribe's Casino Kenosha was sold to Hard Rock International for $621 million.

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino employs over 2,000 people and is a major source of revenue for the city of Milwaukee.

#  Potawatomi Hotel and Casino Tax Dispute Heats Up

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino has been in the news a lot lately, and not for the reasons they would like. The casino, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is currently embroiled in a tax dispute with the state that has led to protests and heated rhetoric on both sides.

The dispute centers on the question of whether the casino should be paying income taxes or not. The Potawatomi assert that their gambling income should be exempt from taxation, as it is considered revenue from an “Indian reservation.” The state of Wisconsin disagrees, arguing that the casino is not on an Indian reservation and should be subject to taxation like any other business.

Officials from the casino have argued that the dispute could result in layoffs and reduced services at the casino. They have also threatened to take their case to court if necessary.

The dispute has caused significant tension between the Potawatomi and state officials. In August, protest erupted outside of the state Capitol building in Madison as tribal members and supporters demonstrated against a potential tax bill. In October, several lawmakers toured the casino as part of a fact-finding mission, which was met with protests from tribal members.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has been a vocal supporter of taxing the Potawatomi casino, arguing that it is unfair for the state to miss out on revenue while other businesses are forced to pay their share. He has also claimed that allowing the casino to avoid taxation amounts to a “corporate welfare” program that benefits only one business.

Governor Walker is up for re-election this November, and it is likely that he will campaign heavily on his support for taxing the casino. His opponent in the race, Democrat Tony Evers, has said that he would work with the tribe to reach a compromise on the issue.

The outcome of this dispute is still uncertain, but it looks likely to continue heating up in the coming months.

#  Potawatomi Hotel and Casino Expansion Approved

The Potawatomi Hotel and Casino in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has been given the green light for an expansion that is expected to create 1,000 jobs. The $425 million project will add a new hotel tower, more gaming space, and additional restaurants.

The expansion has been in the works for several years, but was stalled by a legal challenge from the Forest County Potawatomi tribe. That challenge was eventually dropped, clearing the way for the expansion to proceed.

The new hotel tower is expected to open in 2020, with the rest of the expansion completed by 2021. In addition to creating 1,000 jobs, the expansion is also expected to generate $25 million in new taxes annually.
