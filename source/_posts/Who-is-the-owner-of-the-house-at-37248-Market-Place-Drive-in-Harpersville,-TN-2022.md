Quite often, when someone purchases a house, they have many questions about the property's history. One of the most common questions is "who lived here before us?" This article will explore some methods of finding out who owned a house before the current owners.

One way to find out previous homeowners is through public records. The county or city in which the property is located will likely have records dating back to when the property was first sold. These records will typically include the name of the person who purchased the property and the names of any previous owners.

Another source of information about previous homeowners is tax records. Tax records will list all of the people who have owned a property and for how long. They may also include information about mortgage payments and other liens on the property.

If you're looking for more information about a property's history, you may want to consider hiring a professional historian. Historians can often find information that is not available in public or tax records. They may be able to track down information about former owners, such as their occupation and social status.

It's important to note that not all properties have extensive histories. If your house was built recently, or if it has had few changes over the years, there may not be much information available about previous owners. However, investigating a home's history can still be fun and informative!

#  What is the history of the house?

Over the centuries, the house has passed through many different hands. It has been used as a private residence, a school, and even a hospital. In the early 20th century, it was converted into offices and remained as such until the 1990s.

In 1994, the building was bought by a property developer who planned to demolish it and build luxury apartments on the site. However, local campaigners fought hard to save the house and eventually succeeded in obtaining listed status for it. The developer was forced to abandon his plans and the house was saved from demolition.

Today, it is owned by a charitable trust and open to the public as a museum.
