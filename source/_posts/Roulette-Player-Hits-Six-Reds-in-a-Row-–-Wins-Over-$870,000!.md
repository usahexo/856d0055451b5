In what has been described as a “bizarre streak”, a roulette player at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas hit six consecutive red numbers and walked away with over $870,000 in winnings.

They followed that up with another $100 bet on red on Friday night, and then again on Saturday night. On Sunday, the player upped their bets to $500 per spin and won five times in a row for a total of over $870,000.
