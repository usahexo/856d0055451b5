"There is no limit to the number of casinos that can operate in Lietkabelis," said city spokesperson Sean Donahue.
But some people feel there should be a limit. "The casinos are taking business away from the stores and restaurants in town," said local business owner Hank Bishop.
"They're also attracting criminal elements who are causing problems in our community."
