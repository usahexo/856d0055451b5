      		<h1 id="FC-Bayern-Munich-Tops-Bundesliga-in-Revenue-for-Sixth-Consecutive-Year"><a href="#FC-Bayern-Munich-Tops-Bundesliga-in-Revenue-for-Sixth-Consecutive-Year" class="headerlink" title="FC Bayern Munich Tops Bundesliga in Revenue for Sixth Consecutive Year"></a>FC Bayern Munich Tops Bundesliga in Revenue for Sixth Consecutive Year</h1><p>FC Bayern Munich announced record revenue of €640 million for the 2017-2018 fiscal year. This marks the sixth consecutive year that FC Bayern has topped the Bundesliga in revenue. The club attributes its financial success to continued on-field success and strong commercial partnerships.</p>
<p>Commercial partnerships accounted for €333 million of FC Bayern’s total revenue, a 2% increase from the previous fiscal year. This growth was primarily due to increased sponsorship income and the commencement of a new naming rights agreement with Deutsche Telekom in July 2018. FC Bayern also generated significant broadcast income, totaling €194 million during the 2017-2018 season.</p>
<p>FC Bayern’s on-field performance played a significant role in its overall financial success. The club reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and finished second in the Bundesliga, which resulted in increased matchday and broadcasting income. In addition, FC Bayern recorded an operating profit of €120 million, up from €103 million in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>The club expects its revenue to top €700 million in the current fiscal year, driven by another successful Champions League campaign and strong commercial partnerships. This would make FC Bayern the first German club to break the €700 million barrier in revenue.</p>
<p>FC Bayern Munich’s continued dominance of Bundesliga revenues underscores the strength of Germany’s top football league. With average attendances above 43,000 and lucrative broadcast deals, Bundesliga clubs are well positioned to compete with Europe’s elite clubs on both financial and sporting terms.</p>

<h1 id="FC-Bayern-Munich-Announces-Youth-Academy-Expansion"><a href="#FC-Bayern-Munich-Announces-Youth-Academy-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="FC Bayern Munich Announces Youth Academy Expansion"></a>FC Bayern Munich Announces Youth Academy Expansion</h1><p>FC Bayern Munich AG, one of the largest and most successful professional football clubs in the world, has announced plans to expand its youth academy by building a new training center.</p>
<p>The current academy, which was opened in 2004, is located in the Bavarian town of Munich and covers an area of approximately 45,000 square meters. The new training center will be built on a site of 75,000 square meters and offer accommodation for around 350 young players. In addition to the expanded training facilities, the new center will also include a sports medicine center as well as a Recreational and Education Center.</p>
<p>FC Bayern Munich has a long tradition of developing young talent and has produced some of the world’s top footballers over the years, including Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller, and Manuel Neuer. The expansion of the youth academy will enable the club to continue this tradition and provide even more young players with the opportunity to learn from some of the best coaches in the world.</p>
<p>Ulrich Hoeneß, Chairman of FC Bayern München AG’s Supervisory Board, said: “With this investment we are sending out another clear signal: FC Bayern München is assuming its responsibility to society and investing in tomorrow’s stars.”</p>
<p>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Chairman of FC Bayern München AG’s Executive Board added: “We want to give talented youngsters from our region an opportunity to develop their skills further and become top footballers. Our Youth Academy is one of our key strategic areas.”</p>
<p>The new training center is due to be completed by 2021.</p>
<h1 id="FC-Bayern-Munich-Players-Get-New-Contracts"><a href="#FC-Bayern-Munich-Players-Get-New-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="FC Bayern Munich Players Get New Contracts"></a>FC Bayern Munich Players Get New Contracts</h1><p>Players at Bundesliga club FC Bayern Munich have been rewarded with new contracts, the latest being James Rodríguez and Arturo Vidal.</p>
<p>Rodríguez put pen to paper on a new four-year deal on Thursday, while midfielder Vidal agreed a three-year extension.</p>
<p>The extension for the Chile international was announced on the Bayern website, with the 29-year-old set to stay until June 2022. “I am very happy at Bayern and I want to win more titles here,” said Vidal.</p>
<p>“I am convinced that we have a great team that can achieve big things together.”</p>
<p>Vidal has won four Bundesliga titles, three German Cups and the Champions League since arriving from Juventus in 2015. Proven qualityplayers like @jamesdrodriguez and @kingarturo23 have extended their contracts with #FCBayern. We’re delighted to have them on board for the coming years! #MiaSanMia pic.twitter.com&#x2F;aaf5ZIOf3D — FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) July 12, 2018</p>
<p>Rodríguez, who joined from Real Madrid last summer, has also been impressed by what he has seen since moving to Bavaria. “I am really happy at Bayern and I want to continue winning titles,” said the 26-year-old.</p>
<p>“The club is extremely well managed and there is an excellent team spirit here. I firmly believe we can achieve great things together.”</p>
<pre><code>  Rodríguez and Vidal join Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Jérôme Riedewald, Mats Hummels and Joshua Kimmich in signing new deals in recent months as manager Niko Kovac looks to build a squad capable of challenging for major honors this season. The Croatian coach replaced Jupp Heynckes in May after the 72-year-old led Bayern to a record sixth consecutive Bundesliga title and fourth consecutive German Cup triumph.

<h1 id="FC-Bayern-Munich-Wins-7th-Straight-Bundesliga-Title"><a href="#FC-Bayern-Munich-Wins-7th-Straight-Bundesliga-Title" class="headerlink" title="FC Bayern Munich Wins 7th Straight Bundesliga Title"></a>FC Bayern Munich Wins 7th Straight Bundesliga Title</h1><p>FC Bayern Munich has lifted the Bundesliga trophy for the seventh consecutive season, and this year, it was a close call. The Bavarian giants only secured the title on the final day of the season, edging Borussia Dortmund by two points.</p>
<p>The drama kicked off in December when Bayern lost 2-1 away to RB Leipzig. This loss allowed Dortmund to open up a seven-point lead at the top of the table. Dortmund looked destined to win their first Bundesliga title since 2012 until they suffered a number of defeats in April, allowing Bayern to make a late surge.</p>
<p>Bayern’s biggest test came in their penultimate game of the season when they faced Dortmund at home. The match ended in a 0-0 draw, meaning that Bayern had to win their last game of the season against Eintracht Frankfurt if they wanted to retain their title.</p>
<p>Frankfurt took an early lead in that game, but Bayern hit back with three goals in quick succession to secure all three points and the Bundesliga trophy. This was manager Niko Kovac’s first league title as manager of Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Now that they have won their seventh straight Bundesliga title, Bayern Munich are just one short of equalling the record set by Hamburg SV between 1982 and 1987.</p>
