      		<h1 id="What-is-the-name-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-name-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the name of the game?"></a>What is the name of the game?</h1><p>The name of the game is baseball. It is a sport that is typically played outdoors.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-need-to-play"><a href="#What-do-you-need-to-play" class="headerlink" title="What do you need to play?"></a>What do you need to play?</h1><p>In order to play baseball, you will need at least two people, a ball and a bat.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play"><a href="#How-do-you-play" class="headerlink" title="How do you play?"></a>How do you play?</h1><p>To play baseball, one person pitches the ball to the other player who then tries to hit it with the bat. If the player hits the ball, they run around four bases and then try to get back to home base before the other player can catch the ball. If they are successful, they score a point. If the catcher catches the ball before the runner reaches home base, then the runner is out and no points are scored. The team with more points at the end of nine innings wins the game.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-goal-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-goal-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the goal of the game?"></a>What is the goal of the game?</h1><p>The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored by landing on specific spaces on the board, and then rolling the die to move your pieces forward. The first player to reach the end of the board wins the game.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-players-move-their-pieces-around"><a href="#How-do-players-move-their-pieces-around" class="headerlink" title="How do players move their pieces around?"></a>How do players move their pieces around?</h1><p>Players roll a die numbered one to six in order to determine how far they can move their piece. You can either move one space at a time or you can use your roll to jump over other pieces on the board. If you land on a space with another player’s piece, that player must then go back to the beginning of the board.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-when-a-player-reaches-the-end-of-the-board"><a href="#What-happens-when-a-player-reaches-the-end-of-the-board" class="headerlink" title="What happens when a player reaches the end of the board?"></a>What happens when a player reaches the end of the board?</h1><p>When a player reaches the end of the board, they are declared the winner and all of their pieces are moved back to the beginning of the board. The opponent then has one final turn to try and score some points.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-the-game"><a href="#How-do-you-play-the-game" class="headerlink" title="How do you play the game?"></a>How do you play the game?</h1><p>In order to play the game, you need to first install it. The game can be installed on Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista and XP. Once the game is installed, you can either create a new account or use an existing one.</p>
<p>Then, you will be taken to the main screen where you can see all of the different areas that you can explore. You can also see your current level, experience points, and health points.</p>
<p>To start playing the game, you need to first select an area. There are six different areas that you can choose from: Plains, Forest, Desert, Snowy Mountain, Volcano, and Lava Pit.</p>
<p>Once you have selected an area, you then need to choose a level. The levels are not in any particular order; they are just random. You can see how many experience points are needed for the next level in the lower right-hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Once you have selected a level and an area, you then need to select a weapon. There are eight different weapons that you can choose from: sword and shield, two swords, axe and shield, bow and arrow, staff, mace and shield, and daggers.</p>
<p>You will then start playing the level with your selected weapon. Your goal is to kill all of the enemies that are in the level and then reach the exit portal. If you die during the level, your health points will be reduced to zero and you will have to start over again from the beginning ofthe level.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-features-of-the-game"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-features-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the features of the game?"></a>What are some of the features of the game?</h1><p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an open-world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released worldwide on November 11, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>The game is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the province of Skyrim. The player character is a Dragonborn, a mortal born with the soul of a dragon. Dragons have returned to Tamriel after being absent for thousands of years. The player must defeat Alduin, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world.</p>
<p>Skyrim introduces a number of new gameplay features, including dual wielding and Radiant AI. Radiant AI enables non-player characters to make their own decisions based on radiant story events. Dragons can be killed by using the Dragonrend shout to bring them to earth, or by shooting them with arrows while they are in flight.</p>
<h1 id="What-did-the-critics-say-about-it"><a href="#What-did-the-critics-say-about-it" class="headerlink" title="What did the critics say about it?"></a>What did the critics say about it?</h1><p>The game received critical acclaim upon release. It was praised for its improved graphics and game mechanics over its predecessor Oblivion, the new dragon combat system, and the well written storyline. Reviewers also liked the addition of puzzles and side-quests which contribute to the game’s length.</p>
<h1 id="Who-developed-the-game"><a href="#Who-developed-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Who developed the game?"></a>Who developed the game?</h1><p>The game was developed by Supercell, a Finnish mobile game developer.</p>

Siege units are units that attack from a distance and include units such as wizards, Tesla towers, cannons, and mortars.</p>
