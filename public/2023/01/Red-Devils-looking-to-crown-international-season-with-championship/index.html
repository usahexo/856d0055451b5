      		<h1 id="Red-Devils-looking-to-crown-international-season-with-championship"><a href="#Red-Devils-looking-to-crown-international-season-with-championship" class="headerlink" title="Red Devils looking to crown international season with championship"></a>Red Devils looking to crown international season with championship</h1><p>Manchester United will be looking to add the UEFA Europa League trophy to their cabinet this season, in what has been a largely successful campaign on the international stage.</p>
<p>José Mourinho’s men were unable to progress beyond the group stages of the Champions League, but they have made up for it with some solid performances in the Europa League. They are yet to lose a match in the competition and currently sit at the top of their group with nine points from three games.</p>
<p>The Red Devils will be looking to continue their good form when they take on Anderlecht in the quarter-finals of the Europa League. The Belgian side are no pushovers, but Manchester United should have enough quality in their ranks to see them through to the next round.</p>
<p>Zlatan Ibrahimović has been one of the standout performers for Manchester United this season, and he will be looking to add another European trophy to his collection. The Swedish striker is one of only two players (along with Cristiano Ronaldo) to have won league titles in four different countries, and he will be keen to make his mark in Europe’s second-tier competition.</p>
<p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan has also played a key role for Manchester United this season, and he will be looking to add some silverware to his trophy cabinet. The Armenian midfielder was voted as the Bundesliga player of the year in 2016, and he will be keen to show that he can replicate that form on the big stage.</p>
<p>Manchester United have been buoyed by some positive news ahead of their clash against Anderlecht, with Paul Pogba set to return from injury. The French midfielder has been out of action since December, but he is now back in full training and could make a return against Anderlecht.</p>
<p>If Manchester United can win the Europa League this season, they would become only the fifth club ever win all three major European trophies (the Champions League, Europa League, and UEFA Cup). This would put them up there with some of Europe’s most elite clubs, and it would be a major achievement for José Mourinho’s team.</p>
<h1 id="Lewandowski-Robben-lead-Bayern-in-quest-for-ace"><a href="#Lewandowski-Robben-lead-Bayern-in-quest-for-ace" class="headerlink" title="Lewandowski, Robben lead Bayern in quest for ace"></a>Lewandowski, Robben lead Bayern in quest for ace</h1><p>The German Bundesliga giants, FC Bayern München, kicked off their preseason preparations this week with the hope of adding a fifth European championship trophy to their cabinet.</p>
<p>Led by star forwards Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben, the Bavarians will be looking to take out top contender Real Madrid CF in this year’s Champions League final.</p>
<p>In order to do so, they’ll need to navigate a tricky group that includes Russian side Rostov, Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, and Portuguese outfit SL Benfica.</p>
<p>Manager Carlo Ancelotti has plenty of options at his disposal as he shapes his starting XI for the new season.</p>
<p>In goal, Manuel Neuer is looking to bounce back from an injury-plagued 2016-17 campaign and recapture his spot as one of the world’s best netminders.</p>
<p>At center back, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng will likely be partnered once again after playing together at the World Cup in Russia. Joshua Kimmich could also see time in the heart of the defense after excelling at right back last season.</p>
<p>otions In midfield, Arturo Vidal and Thiago Alcântara are expected to start in central positions, but Kingsley Coman, Renato Sanches, and James Rodríguez offer plenty of ooptions wingers Rafinha and Sebastian Rudy should provide cover across the midfield. up front With Robben and Franck Ribéry both 36 years old, there could be opportunities for young wingers Serge Gnabry andMarco Reus who recently returned from a long-term injury layoff). son), whileLewandowski (29 years old) will spearhead the attack .</p>
<h1 id="Pep-Guardiola’s-side-one-win-away-from-Bundesliga-title"><a href="#Pep-Guardiola’s-side-one-win-away-from-Bundesliga-title" class="headerlink" title="Pep Guardiola’s side one win away from Bundesliga title"></a>Pep Guardiola’s side one win away from Bundesliga title</h1><p>Bayern Munich will be crowned Bundesliga champions for the fifth consecutive season if they win at home to RB Leipzig on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola’s side hold a 20-point lead over second-placed Borussia Dortmund with just six matches remaining and require just one more victory to seal a fourth successive league title.</p>
<p>Guardiola is bidding to become only the third coach after Carlo Ancelotti and Ottmar Hitzfeld to win three Bundesliga titles with two different clubs.</p>
<p>“We’re on the verge of our objective,” said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. “We want to be champions as soon as possible and we’re taking things one step at a time.”</p>
<p>Leipzig, who are unbeaten in their last 10 matches, will provide a tough test for Bayern, but the hosts are expected to prevail with new signing James Rodriguez set to make his debut.</p>
<h1 id="Bremen-looking-to-stop-Bayern-title-party"><a href="#Bremen-looking-to-stop-Bayern-title-party" class="headerlink" title="Bremen looking to stop Bayern title party"></a>Bremen looking to stop Bayern title party</h1><p>FC Bayern München are all but champions of the Bundesliga once again, but they face a tricky away trip to SV Werder Bremen on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Bavarians have been all but unstoppable this season and are currently on an 18-game winning streak in the league. That has seen them open up an unassailable lead at the top of the table, with nearest challengers RB Leipzig 14 points behind.</p>
<p>While there is little to play for in terms of the title race, Bayern will be keen to maintain their unbeaten record under head coach Jupp Heynckes and notch another win on the road.</p>
<p>Heynckes could rotate his squad given that they have a Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid coming up next week, but it is hard to see too many changes with Bayern looking so dominant in their last few outings.</p>
<p>Werder Bremen, meanwhile, have had a mixed season. They sit in 11th place in the table but are just four points clear of the drop zone. Florian Kohfeldt’s side have improved since he took over as head coach in December, though, and they will be keen to cause an upset against Bayern on Saturday.</p>
<p>One player who could feature for Werder Bremen is Serge Gnabry. The 22-year-old spent last season on loan at the club from Arsenal and has been in excellent form this term, scoring 12 goals in 26 appearances.</p>
<p>Gnabry could cause Bayern problems if he plays tomorrow, and he will no doubt be looking to score against his former club.</p>
<h1 id="Sixth-straight-Bundesliga-title-in-sight-for-Die-Roten"><a href="#Sixth-straight-Bundesliga-title-in-sight-for-Die-Roten" class="headerlink" title="Sixth straight Bundesliga title in sight for Die Roten"></a>Sixth straight Bundesliga title in sight for Die Roten</h1><p>The Bundesliga is back and Bayern Munich are looking to make it six straight titles. Carlo Ancelotti’s men have dominated the German top flight in recent years and show no sign of relinquishing their grip on the trophy.</p>
<p>With the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Arturo Vidal and Thomas Muller in their ranks, Bayern are one of the team’s to beat in Europe this season. They were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid last year, but will be determined to go one better this time around.</p>
<p>The Bavarian club have started the new season in good form, winning all four of their opening matches. They face a tricky test on Saturday when they travel to face RB Leipzig, who have made a good start to life in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Leipzig are one of the surprise packages of the season so far and currently sit second in the table, behind Bayern. However, Die Roten will be confident of picking up all three points against their newly-promoted opponents.</p>
<p>Ancelotti has a number of selection headaches ahead of Saturday’s game, with a number of players returning from injury. Javi Martinez and Kingsley Coman are both doubts for the clash at Red Bull Arena, while Arjen Robben is set to make his return from injury.</p>
<p>Bayern will be looking to make it six wins out of six in the Bundesliga and continue their march towards another title.</p>
