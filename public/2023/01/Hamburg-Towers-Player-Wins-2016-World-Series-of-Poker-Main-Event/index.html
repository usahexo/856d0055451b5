<p>This was Cynn’s first-ever WSOP cash, and his improbable victory came in only his fourth year playing in the Main Event. To put this into perspective, the average length of time it takes most players to make it to the final table is around nine years.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the final table, Cynn had been playing some of his best poker ever. This included a remarkable pot in which he called an all-in bluff with only king-high.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Cynn would go on to win the tournament after defeating Tony Miles heads-up. This victory netted him a whopping $8.8 million payday, as well as world champion status.</p>
<p>For Hamburg Towers coach and owner Dieter Schmidt-Vogt, seeing one of his players attain such a prestigious title is incredibly rewarding. “It’s obviously very special when one of your players wins something like that – especially the Main Event,” Schmidt-Vogt said in an interview with PokerNews shortly after Cynn’s win. “The WSOP is the biggest and most prestigious poker tournament in the world, so it’s a great feeling to have one of my players win it.”</p>
<p>While Cynn is now considered one of the best poker players in the world, he doesn’t take his success for granted. In fact, immediately following his win he expressed gratitude for everyone who had helped him along the way. “I want to thank my coach and everyone else who has helped me out along the way – without them I never would have made it here today.,” Cynn said in a post-victory interview.</p>
<p>With Hamburg Towers’ support – both financial and emotional – Cynn is sure to achieve even more great successes in the future. Congratulations once again to John Cynn on becoming World Series of Poker Main Event champion!</p>
<h1 id="Hamburg-Towers-Crowned-2016-World-Series-of-Poker-Champions"><a href="#Hamburg-Towers-Crowned-2016-World-Series-of-Poker-Champions" class="headerlink" title="Hamburg Towers Crowned 2016 World Series of Poker Champions"></a>Hamburg Towers Crowned 2016 World Series of Poker Champions</h1><p>The128 th World Series of Poker crowned a new champion on Tuesday night, as 24-year-old Hamburg resident Johannes Becker won the $10,000 buy-in no-limit Texas hold’em tournament. Becker, who began the final table as the chip leader, defeated American pro Brian Rast in a heads-up match to take home the $8 million first prize.</p>
<p>The victory was Becker’s first major title, and caps a remarkable year for the young German player. In January, Becker won a $1,500 no-limit event at the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure in the Bahamas, earning him his first six-figure score.</p>
<p>Rast, who began heads up play with a 2-to-1 chip advantage, put up a valiant fight but ultimately fell to Becker’s aggression. The two players clashed in a series of huge pots, with Becker eventually emerging victorious.</p>
<p>“I just kept playing my game and it worked out in the end,” said Becker after his victory. “I can’t believe it – I’m really happy!”</p>
<p>The 2016 WSOP main event was one of the most competitive in years, with a field of 6,737 players generating a total prize pool of $64 million. The final table included some of the world’s best players, including Spanish superstar Antonio Esfandiari and former world champion Jonathan Duhamel of Canada.</p>
<p>Duhamel finished in third place for $4 million, while Esfandiari bowed out in fourth place for $3 million. Belgian pro Kenny Hallaert took home $2 million for fifth place, and American pro Michael Mizrachi earned $1.5 million for sixth place.</p>
<h1 id="Incredible-Upset-as-Hamburg-Towers-Wins-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event"><a href="#Incredible-Upset-as-Hamburg-Towers-Wins-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Incredible Upset as Hamburg Towers Wins World Series of Poker Main Event"></a>Incredible Upset as Hamburg Towers Wins World Series of Poker Main Event</h1><p>In a huge upset, Hamburg Towers has won the World Series of Poker main event, besting a field of 6,737 players and taking home the $8.5 million first-place prize.</p>
<p>This is the first time in history that a German player has won the main event, and Hamburg Towers (real name: Julian Herold) is elated. “I still can’t believe it,” he said after his win. “I’m so happy right now.”</p>
<p>Towers’ victory capped off an amazing summer for him; in addition to winning the main event, he also won two other tournaments earlier in the series. “It’s been an unbelievable few months,” he said. “To win three tournaments at the world’s biggest poker series is a dream come true.”</p>
<p>The final table of the main event was a star-studded affair, with Phil Ivey, Vanessa Selbst, and Daniel Negreanu all making it to the final nine players. But in the end it was Towers who came out on top, defeating Negreanu heads-up to take home the title.</p>
<p>For Negreanu, it was yet another close call at the WSOP main event. He has now finished second four times in this prestigious tournament (more than any other player), but he was gracious in defeat on this occasion. “Julian played great and deserved to win,” he said after being eliminated.</p>
<p>With this victory, Hamburg Towers has cemented his place as one of the greatest poker players of all time. He is now only the second player ever to win three major titles at the WSOP (the other being Doyle Brunson). Not bad for a guy who only started playing poker six years ago!</p>
<h1 id="Hamburg-Towers-Defeats-Top-Poker-Pros-to-Win-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event"><a href="#Hamburg-Towers-Defeats-Top-Poker-Pros-to-Win-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Hamburg Towers Defeats Top Poker Pros to Win World Series of Poker Main Event"></a>Hamburg Towers Defeats Top Poker Pros to Win World Series of Poker Main Event</h1><p>The Hamburg Towers, a professional poker team from Germany, defied all odds this week by winning the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event. This was the team’s first ever WSOP victory, and they did it by defeating some of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<p>The final table of the Main Event featured several top pros, including Jason Les, Mike Matusow, and Phil Hellmuth. But in the end, it was the Hamburg Towers who came out on top.</p>
<p>The team’s victory was especially impressive given that they only started playing together a few months ago. They had been practicing hard and studying the game meticulously, and it clearly paid off.</p>
<p>“We’re ecstatic about our win,” said Tobias Reinkemeier, captain of the Hamburg Towers. “This is a dream come true for all of us.”</p>
<p>Reinkemeier was joined at the final table by teammates Paul Michaelis and Dieter Volker. All three players contributed to the team’s victory, with Michaelis finishing in 4th place and Volker in 5th.</p>
<p>“I’m so proud of my teammates,” said Reinkemeier. “They both played brilliantly at the final table.”</p>
<p>The Hamburg Towers are now considered one of the top poker teams in the world, and they will surely be one of the teams to beat in future tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="Hamburg-Towers-Crowned-Kings-of-the-2016-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event"><a href="#Hamburg-Towers-Crowned-Kings-of-the-2016-World-Series-of-Poker-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Hamburg Towers Crowned Kings of the 2016 World Series of Poker Main Event"></a>Hamburg Towers Crowned Kings of the 2016 World Series of Poker Main Event</h1><p>The much-anticipated 2016 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event concluded on Tuesday night with German poker pro Stefan Schaffelhuber taking down the coveted $8 million first prize and world championship bracelet.</p>
<p>Schaffelhuber, a 31-year-old professional poker player from Hamburg, started the final table as the chip leader and never looked back, emerging victorious after a grueling 10-hour heads-up battle against American pro Ryan Riess.</p>
<p>The Main Event began way back in July with a record-breaking field of 7,874 players, all of whom were vying for their chance at poker immortality. After six grueling days of play, the final table was set, with Schaffelhuber the clear favorite to take home the title.</p>
<p>The final table consisted of some of the most talented and experienced players in the world, including Riess (a two-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner), Max Steinberg (a former November Niner), Kenny Hallaert (the 2016 European Poker Tour Player of the Year) and Michael Ruane (the runner-up in last year’s Main Event).</p>
<p>However, in the end it was Schaffelhuber who prevailed, beating Riess in an epic heads-up battle to become only the second German player ever to win the WSOP Main Event. The first was Peter Eichhardt way back in 1987.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how each player at the final table finished:</p>
<p>1st – Stefan Schaffelhuber (Germany) – $8 million<br>2nd – Ryan Riess (USA) – $4.7 million<br>3rd – Kenny Hallaert (Belgium) – $3 million<br>4th – Michael Ruane (USA) – $2.1 million<br>5th – Vojtech Ruzicka (Czech Republic) – $1.6 million<br>6th – Griffin Benger (Canada) – $1.25 million<br>7th – Pierre Neuville (Belgium) – $1 million<br>8th – Tony Gregg (USA) – $850,000<br>9th – Niall Farrell (UK) -$700,000</p>
